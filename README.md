# File Sender (WebRTC)

#### The project is under construction! Do not use!

A simple example of using WebRTC technology to create a file transfer channel.

[WebRTC] technology allows you to establish formal and secure connections between clients,
but everything is possible in our world :). I am not responsible for your use of this project.
You are acting at your own risk.
